    <h3>Storytime:</h3>
    <p style="color: burlywood ;">
      Blue's Resturant started out as a dream realized by Jay Kenya in 2010. Jay
      set out to create a dining experience unlike any other in westlands
      because she had a deep passion for culinary arts and wanted to share the
      rich, diverse flavors of Chiken ticca. What began as a small restaurant
      has grown into a well-liked dining destination. We've stuck to our core
      values over the years: finding the best seasonal and local ingredients,
      carefully preparing each dish, and creating a welcoming environment where
      visitors are treated like family. Every meal has a backstory, and our
      history is proof of innumerable meals spent together, happy occasions, and
      the steadfast support of our beloved neighborhood.
